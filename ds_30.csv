53|Senior Data Scientist|"Who we are:

Rover.com connects pet parents with the nations largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers. On Rover, pet parents can easily discover, book, and manage personalized care for their dogs including pet sitting, dog walking, and doggy day care. Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.

We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies. Our Senior Leadership team has been recognized by Forbes, Seattle Business, and Geekwire. For the past three years we have been nominated as one of Seattle's ""Best Places to Work"" by Seattle Business Magazine, and celebrated awards in 2016 and 2017 by Seattle Met magazine and the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're also the recipient of Worlds Most Dog-Friendly Offices in 2016 by Inc.com. Needless to say (but we're going to say it anyway)we love dogs, and we wouldn't dream of going to work without them by our sides.

Who we're looking for:

The Senior Data Scientist at Rover will possess broad enough experience to contribute to each of the three classes of problem outlined above, while also being deep enough to lead at least one of them end-to-end. In every case, and regardless of the specific techniques employed, the Senior Data Scientist will be responsible for managing long-running experiments with significant impact on how users interact with Rover.com, participate in our marketplace, and find care for their dogs. This is a non-trivial responsibility: on the one hand, there is tremendous value to be driven in continuing to optimize the Rover marketplace, while on the other hand the opportunity cost associated with long-running experiments (in time and dollars) is very high.

For this reason, real-world experience in this class of problem is a requirement, and experience working in an online marketplace specifically is strongly preferred.

What does Data Science mean at Rover?

There are three broad classes of core Data Science problems with which we are engaged at Rover:

1. Multivariate modeling: the creation of models that lead to better search outcomes, providing better matches between dog sitters and owners. Here, success is measured in terms of impact on marketplace efficiency

2. Machine learning: the ongoing development of the machine learning infrastructure that enables continuous learning from our data, where success is also measured in terms of marketplace efficiency gains as well as the rate at which different aspects of the user experience are incorporated into our ML systems

3. Scaling user testing: the parallelization and democratization of end-user testing across all aspects of the product and user experience, where success is measured in terms of testing velocity across the organization
Your Toolset Includes:
SQL
Python
Probably at least one additional programming language / computational programming environment; e.g., R, Matlab, C++, etc
Google Analytics or similar user funnel analytics tools

Strong technical and coding skills
Deep expertise in one or more core data science disciplines (e.g, supervised learning, machine learning, etc)
Marketplace experience strongly preferred
Experience in online user testing strongly preferred
Why Well Hire You:
You are familiar with more than just the basics, and have more than cursory experience with at least sub-discipline in the broad field of data science. In other words, you know where the sharp edges are, and can lead decisions around what techniques are and are not appropriate to employ for particular classes of problem
Youre a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business).
You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a dog sitter and a dog owner on the Rover platform.
You can take abstractly defined problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions
You are a great partner to engineers and business owners alike
You can pitch your own ideas and shepherd them through to completion
You show pattern of being self-started, self-taught and self-directed
You favor open communication with willingness to ask and answer questions

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.People issue over 2 billion searches on Facebook every day to find people, pages, videos, and connect with the communities and interests that matter to them. Facebook Search team is working to build a global, general-purpose search engine that leverages the unique content and social connections on Facebook. By unlocking the unique information and connections available on Facebook, we believe we can provide a more meaningful experience for people around the world, especially in mobile-first countries. To achieve our goal, we need to solve some of the most challenging engineering problems in the industry, across areas such as Infrastructure, Product, Mobile, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Being a complex engineering system, Facebook Search depends on several machine learning models and heavy natural language processing. Understanding the user's search intent from their search query is crucial to retrieving and matching the right content from Facebook's vast amount of social data. NLP team focuses on developing various machine learning technologies to process and transform a search query into a form that is utilized by the subsequent systems for retrieval and ranking. Context of the search query and its implicit and explicit semantics play an important role in satisfying the searcher's information need. Similar technologies are utilized to decipher the meaning and intent of the content in Facebook to create the matching between user intent and content.
A Data Scientist in this role will leverage his knowledge and understanding of these technologies along with the vast and powerful search dataset in order to: (1) provide tactical engineering systems development guidance by bridging lower level NLP system components' performance to higher level product performance (2) perform various forms of opportunity analyses to influence NLP systems development roadmap and (3) collaborate with software engineers to help develop better ways of understanding search queries and content on Facebook. This is a key role within the greater search team and it requires heavy involvement with technical aspects of the core search technology.

190|Senior Data Scientist|"Job Description
Niels Bohr once said “It is very hard to predict, especially the future.” And in a way, that’s really what we are trying to do. We are building a small Science and ML Technology team to focus on improving the customer delivery experience by detecting patterns, trends, and insights ""hiding"" in massive amounts of data. Then, leveraging science and intelligent ML to highlight the biggest opportunities and systematically reduce and eliminate classes of defects in order of impact and importance. Our work will directly impact millions of daily package deliveries worldwide and help assure we keep our customer promise of delivering packages to the right place, at the right time, and with the right level of professionalism. We will continuously learn, innovate, and improve the Amazon customer delivery experience. If you have expert level skills and want to be part of this special group read on and apply.

We have unmatched obsession for our many millions of customers around the globe. At Amazon the impact of our work is massive, and our work on the Last Mile team begins shortly after our customers complete their shopping mission on our site. Whatever they ordered, large or small, is making its way thru our logistics system and eventually the customer’s front door.

We are looking for a Data Scientist who will analyze drivers and operators, different cities, and different types of addresses. You'll have data for different types of deliveries, and different types of customers, and you will spend your time as a hands-on Data Scientist practitioner and thought leader. You will source much of your own data for modeling, and identify gaps in data availability and data reliability.

On a day-to-day basis you will:
Analyze and solve business problems at their root, stepping back to understand the broader context.
Disambiguate problems and develop new metrics for identifying and tracking success
Utilize database technologies, including SQL, ETL, EMR, and Redshift to shape data and statistical modeling packages like R and python to build customer models.
Establish scalable, efficient, automated processes for large scale data analyses, model development, model validation, and model implementation.
Manage and execute entire projects or components of large projects from start to finish including project management, data gathering and manipulation, synthesis and modeling, problem solving, and communication of insights and recommendations.
As the Science and ML technology team our job is to leverage big data to identify key patterns of success and failure, identify the areas we need to focus on first, understand root cause(s) that triggered failure, and to build predictive models that will help fix the most impactful problems. The amount of data, the variables that come into play, and diversity of customers and locations make this role very challenging and also fun. It starts with dealing with enough ambiguity that’ll scare most people away, entails asking lots of smart question that will lead to the discovery of universal concepts, and truly innovative ML solutions that continuously improve the customer delivery experience. Every member of the team will be an independent thinker, with a burning desire to learn, and have the skills and experience needed to build science and technology so advanced that it will appear to generate “magical outcomes”.

In terms of Amazon Leadership Principles, the most important ones for our team are: Customer Obsession, Think Big, Dive Deep, and Invent and Simplify.

You’ll be based in Seattle, WA

A Sr. Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazons internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Sr. Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations.
As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance. While business intelligence tends to be structured, data science leans more toward the unstructured. You must deal with incomplete, messy, unorganized data, not immediately usable without some degree of cleaning and prepping. You will generate predictive insights and new product innovations by applying advanced analytical tools and algorithms utilizing advanced statistical packages, SQL, Hadoop, and open source tools like Python and Perl.

In 2018, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.

The ADAI has been the home for the Pacific Northwest Node of the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) since 2001. The CTN’s goal is to move substance abuse treatments with demonstrated efficacy into community-based treatment settings to determine their effectiveness when implemented in real-world treatment settings.

The Research Scientist position is at the intersection of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention. The Research Scientist will function as the National Project Director for two HIV prevention studies in the CTN. One has been funded (http://ctndisseminationlibrary.org/protocols/ctn0082.htm) and is an HIV prevention implementation science survey study designed to identify barriers and facilitators to scaling up Pre-Exposure Phrophylaxis (PrEP) to substance-using men who have sex with men in high-HIV incidence cities in the US. A second study, awaiting funding, is a medication adherence trial of PrEP in substance-using men who have sex with men and in people who inject drugs. This position will work with Lead Investigators at ADAI, Columbia and Yale Universities, and with other Lead Team members, on the development, implementation, and dissemination of the studies. Secondarily, this position may involve work on other opioid-related clinical treatment trials on an as-needed basis. Examples include a rapid buprenorphine induction trial in emergency departments, and an evaluation of rural hub-and-spoke models to deliver medication assisted treatment to people with opioid use disorders in rural Washington.

As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.

Health Sciences Administration has an outstanding opportunity for a Research Scientist.

Recognizing a need to address the enormous problems caused by alcohol and drug abuse, UW established the Alcohol & Drug Abuse Institute (ADAI) in October, 1973 as an interdisciplinary research center. From its beginning, the mission of ADAI has been to conduct and support substance abuse research at UW, and disseminate research findings on substance abuse.

The ADAI has been the home for the Pacific Northwest Node of the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) since 2001. The CTN’s goal is to move substance abuse treatments with demonstrated efficacy into community-based treatment settings to determine their effectiveness when implemented in real-world treatment settings.

The Research Scientist position is at the intersection of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention. The Research Scientist will function as the National Project Director for two HIV prevention studies in the CTN. One has been funded (http://ctndisseminationlibrary.org/protocols/ctn0082.htm) and is an HIV prevention implementation science survey study designed to identify barriers and facilitators to scaling up Pre-Exposure Phrophylaxis (PrEP) to substance-using men who have sex with men in high-HIV incidence cities in the US. A second study, awaiting funding, is a medication adherence trial of PrEP in substance-using men who have sex with men and in people who inject drugs. This position will work with Lead Investigators at ADAI, Columbia and Yale Universities, and with other Lead Team members, on the development, implementation, and dissemination of the studies. Secondarily, this position may involve work on other opioid-related clinical treatment trials on an as-needed basis. Examples include a rapid buprenorphine induction trial in emergency departments, and an evaluation of rural hub-and-spoke models to deliver medication assisted treatment to people with opioid use disorders in rural Washington.

RESPONSIBILITIES:
• Project management and oversight of multi-site clinical trials across all phases of the research, including protocol development, implementation, study closeout and dissemination. This includes regulatory management, supervision of RC/RAs, oversight of data collection, development of training materials, consultation as needed on fidelity monitoring, recruitment tracking and troubleshooting, coordination between sites and the national coordinating center, and subsequent collaboration on manuscripts.

• Manage the day-to-day research operations of the project(s), including monitoring staff activities at study sites. Troubleshoot recruitment and retention at participating sites and consult with local implementation teams on strategies for attaining recruitment & retention goals. Problem solve accordingly.
• Develop and monitor protocol implementation timelines for on time task completion. Report study progress to Lead Team investigators, and Pacific Northwest Node operations committee on a regular basis.
• Convey general information to research and clinical/administrative staff of participating agencies about the protocols such as goals, hypotheses, working knowledge of protocol, procedures, and staffing needs.
• Attend all Lead Team protocol implementation conference calls, organize and sustain protocol conference calls with local agency staff on an as-needed basis.
• Work with the Clinical Coordinating Center to oversee quality assurance and regulatory affairs for adherence and compliance with human subject and HIPPA regulations at participating agencies.
• Work with the Clinical Coordinating Center to manage IRB correspondence for protocols.
• Assist in planning, preparing, and presenting at protocol training sessions (including travel to such meetings if necessary); ensure completion of local training requirements associated with each protocol.

394|Operations Research Scientist|"Job Description
Take hundreds of millions of shipments, a gigantic fulfillment network, reliable premium delivery service and optimizing decisions on transportation cost (involving billions of dollars in transportation spend). Combine this with the opportunity to be a key research leader and individual contributor building innovative transportation capabilities for the world’s most customer-centric company and what do you get? The best optimization R&D role- period.

The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors, third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandise from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection – merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs – this selection is key to Amazon’s virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers; this involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, this presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.

Modeling and Optimization team is responsible for building network optimization models and analytic tools that improve the economics of the North American, European, and Asian fulfillment networks as Amazon increases the speed and decreases the cost to deliver product to customers. We are looking for motivated individuals with strong numerical optimization and analysis skills to join our team focusing on transportation network modeling and design. You will be responsible for building tools to determine the means to efficiently transport shipments from vendors to our fulfillment centers, as well as from fulfillment centers to our customers. In particular, you will focus on building models that will be leveraged to drive the optimization of the transportation infrastructure, transportation contract negotiation, increase speed of delivery and evaluate opportunities to decrease cost through new initiatives. Some of the key job responsibilities
Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with the transportation network including network optimization, process improvement and sizing up opportunities from new initiatives. Build prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to the decision systems and operational processes.

Partner closely with business and IT groups. Provide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to benchmark existing operations/processes as well as to identify opportunities for improvement. Work closely with IT teams in enhancing the prototypes and implementing them in our production environment.
Effectively communicate with senior management as well as with colleagues from computer science, operations research and business backgrounds.

A proven history of driving critical research and development, algorithms and optimization is needed to be successful in this role.

Amazon is an Equal Opportunity-Affirmative Action Employer – Minority / Female / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation.
Basic Qualifications

Senior Application Data Engineer
Location: Seattle
Department: Engineering
Description
Can you own the data layer, guiding the underlying data architecture to support a fast growing application stack? Do you enjoy working closely with software engineers to develop and refine software systems? Can discriminate use cases between transactionally consistent, ACID-compliant systems of record vs. eventually consistent options vs non-traditional data stores?

This role will be part of our data engineering group that works closely with our feature product teams facilitating the underlying data model and architecture as our product evolves. Knowledge and experience within systems and software architecture is required.

Porch’s tech stack has evolved around Microservices Architecture and underlying micro-databases. We integrate the application of DDL and DML into our software CI systems via Flyway so that our services have true ownership of our data. We have our domain / canonical model represented behind their own APIs as part of a master data management solution. PostgreSQL is our relational database of choice.

Responsibilities:

The Architecture Stuff:
Data Architecture - You will need to ensure we have the correct level of normalization to support that application features. Maintain the integrity of the underlying data, ensure we have a transactionally consistent view of the data when necessary and support eventually consistent data representations when appropriate.
Domain Modeling - Is A a part of B or a part of C or is A actually D? Sometimes microservices get scope creep, it is generally most apparent and least reversible at the data layer. Be comfortable asking questions and giving frank answers.
OLTP vs. OLAP - Is the request a functional requirement of the application or a reporting need? Keep analytical requirements out of transactional systems and evangelize the usage of the data warehouse. Be the bridge between the Engineering, Product, and Development (EPD) teams and the Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Warehouse.
The Engineering Stuff: You will work with several software engineering teams to ensure the application is supported by a high quality data layer. This means you need to own:
Data Migrations - Underlying data model changes? New features? Migration plans may be needed to support the evolution of the systems while maximizing availability.
Technologies - Not everything has to be in a relational database. Be open to leveraging key-value stores, document databases, and other technologies to provide the right tool for the job.
Process Improvement - Is there a better way? Periodically question what, how and why you are doing a task. Don’t be a drone.
Collaboration - Vertically: fulfill the needs of the application layer and front end. Horizontally: communicate and coordinate with data engineering team to establish conventions, utilize best practices and share lessons learned.
Scaling - Identify appropriate applications of partitioning and sharding.
Experience:

At least five years as a software, systems, or data engineer during which you:
Have been the go to for query optimization and performance troubleshooting.
Have had 3+ years owning DDL and data model implementations in production environments.
Are comfortable being part of the on-call rotation. Everyone is on the on-call rotation.
Have done all of these things in a cloud environment—AWS, GCP, or other public cloud.

Department: INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH METRICS AND EVALUATION
Job Location: South Lake Union
Posting Date: 06/20/2018
Closing Info: Open Until Filled
Salary: Salary is commensurate with experience and education
Shift: First Shift

As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications.

These positions position must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. The Data Analyst must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages such (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers.

Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available.
Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include:

Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD): A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

Local Burden of Disease: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.

Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.

Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.

Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.

Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.

Responsibilities include:

Research command

Work directly with researchers to identify the source of data used in models and results, understand the context of the data, and ensure that they are relevant to the analyses themselves.
Create and document efficient, effective, and replicable methods for extracting data, developing code, organizing data sources, managing data quality, and explaining complex analytic processes.

Data management and analytics
Problem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.
Implement code solutions in order to answer analytic questions, perform diagnostics on results, and test and assess new methods.
Maintain, update, and adapt databases containing health data from multiple sources such as surveys, vital registration systems, administrative records, and published studies relevant to demographic estimation
Maintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.
Execute queries on databases and resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.
Bring together data, analytic engines, and data visualizations in one seamless computational process.
Use protocols to identify problems with datasets and routine computational processes, rectify issues, and systematize data for future analyses
Transform and format data sets for use in ongoing analyses. Catalogue and incorporate these datasets into databases.Perform quality checks.

General
Create tables, figures, and charts for presentations and publications.
Provide referencing and other support for publications and presentations.
Communicate clearly and effectively while contributing as a member of both the Institute.
Work closely with other team members to assist with relevant tasks, facilitate learning new skills, and to help resolve emerging problems on different projects.

Department: INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH METRICS AND EVALUATION
Job Location: South Lake Union
Posting Date: 06/20/2018
Closing Info: Open Until Filled
Salary: Salary is commensurate with experience and education
Shift: First Shift

As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications.

These positions position must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. The Data Analyst must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages such (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers.

Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available.
Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include:

Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD): A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

Local Burden of Disease: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.

Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.

Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.

Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.

Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.

Responsibilities include:

Research command
Become familiar with substantive areas of expertise to understand the dimensions and uses of health data and the analytic underpinnings of different research streams.
Work directly with researchers to identify the source of data used in models and results, understand the context of the data, and ensure that they are relevant to the analyses themselves.
Create and document efficient, effective, and replicable methods for extracting data, developing code, organizing data sources, managing data quality, and explaining complex analytic processes.

Data management and analytics
Problem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.
Implement code solutions in order to answer analytic questions, perform diagnostics on results, and test and assess new methods.
Maintain, update, and adapt databases containing health data from multiple sources such as surveys, vital registration systems, administrative records, and published studies relevant to demographic estimation
Maintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.
Execute queries on databases and resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.
Bring together data, analytic engines, and data visualizations in one seamless computational process.
Use protocols to identify problems with datasets and routine computational processes, rectify issues, and systematize data for future analyses
Transform and format data sets for use in ongoing analyses. Catalogue and incorporate these datasets into databases.Perform quality checks.

General
Create tables, figures, and charts for presentations and publications.
Provide referencing and other support for publications and presentations.
Communicate clearly and effectively while contributing as a member of both the Institute.
Work closely with other team members to assist with relevant tasks, facilitate learning new skills, and to help resolve emerging problems on different projects.
Participate in overall community of the Institute, carrying out duties as required as team members with other Institute members.

Nice to meet you! I'm often regarded as one of the geekiest Recruiters in the industry and I couldn't be more proud to be honest. I've loved computers since my Texas Instruments TI-99/4A in 1981, followed by a Laser 128, which was an Apple II clone manufactured by Vtech. I introduced Apple Logo (think similar to Lisp) to my Elementary School and helped teach after school classes on the Apple II. Fast forward three-decades later, I'm still playing with code, deploying systems on AWS EC2/S3 and for the past 16+ years have built some of the most prestigious enterprise and consumer software companies in the world. You can expect that I will never spam your resume anywhere. I'm incredibly technical and have a deep understanding the technology and trends that make our industry go around. I'm a wealth of opportunities that you wouldn't likely find elsewhere as the best roles are rarely advertised.

Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun.

Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today.

Our team is building the Map Perception component of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK, with the goal to create a scalable crowd-sourced mapping platform for autonomous driving, that will enable a fleet of autonomous vehicles to create and consume map data collaboratively.

Typical algorithms used include RANSAC, Gauss-Newton Optimization, SLAM, ICP, Monte-Carlo localization, Hough Transform, CNN, etc.
You will help solidify existing algorithms, and work with large amounts of real and synthetic data to continuously improve the algorithmic and computational performance.
Focus will be given to developing highly efficient product code in C++, making use of high algorithmic parallelism offered by GPGPU programming (CUDA).
Code written must comply to strict quality and safety standards such as defined by MISRA.
What We Need To See
MS degree and 5 plus years of industry experience
To be successful you should have experience in one or more of the following areas: Computer vision, visual geometry, LIDAR perception, SLAM and/or deep learning.

Experience with visual geometry and deep learning in a shipping product context.
Software development on embedded platforms or large scale cloud services.
Experience with GPGPU programming (CUDA and OpenCL).
We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents are responsible for ~1.25 million deaths per year world-wide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team.

NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers with some of the most brilliant and talented people in the world working here. If you're creative and autonomous, we want to hear from you!

875|Data Analyst|"The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications.

These positions position must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. The Data Analyst must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages such (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers.

Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available.

Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include:

Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD): A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.

Local Burden of Disease: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.

Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.

Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.

Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.

Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.

Responsibilities include:

Research command
Become familiar with substantive areas of expertise to understand the dimensions and uses of health data and the analytic underpinnings of different research streams.
Work directly with researchers to identify the source of data used in models and results, understand the context of the data, and ensure that they are relevant to the analyses themselves.
Create and document efficient, effective, and replicable methods for extracting data, developing code, organizing data sources, managing data quality, and explaining complex analytic processes.
Data management and analytics
Problem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.
Implement code solutions in order to answer analytic questions, perform diagnostics on results, and test and assess new methods.
Maintain, update, and adapt databases containing health data from multiple sources such as surveys, vital registration systems, administrative records, and published studies relevant to demographic estimation
Maintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.
Execute queries on databases and resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.
Bring together data, analytic engines, and data visualizations in one seamless computational process.
Use protocols to identify problems with datasets and routine computational processes, rectify issues, and systematize data for future analyses
Transform and format data sets for use in ongoing analyses. Catalogue and incorporate these datasets into databases. Perform quality checks.
General
Create tables, figures, and charts for presentations and publications.
Provide referencing and other support for publications and presentations.
