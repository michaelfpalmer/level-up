# level-up
## BusinessUnderstanding
As a job hunter, I want to know what are some skills to develop in order to level-up in my career. 

Based on a collection of existing skills, I will find the current market value of the skills, and the incremental value of adding new skills.

In addition, I will explore many aspects of job hunting. For example, what words should job seekers pay the most attention to in the hunt? Which words matter the least. Are there things that exist in every job description that are essentially meaningless, such as, "Excellent written and oral communication skills"? While these may be important in every job, they don't distinguish the particular job from other jobs.
