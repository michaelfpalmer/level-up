74|Senior Computer Vision Software Engineer for Autonomous Vehicles|"We are now looking for a Senior Computer Vision Software Engineer for Autonomous Vehicles
Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error — this is truly an extraordinary time and the era of AI has begun.
Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and AI come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Make the choice to join us today.
Our team is building the Map Perception component of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK, with the goal to build a scalable crowd-sourced mapping platform for autonomous driving, that will enable a fleet of autonomous vehicles to create and consume map data collaboratively.
We are seeking senior software engineers with interests in computer vision, mapping, LiDAR perception, deep learning, sensor fusion, and other related areas, to work as part of NVIDIA’s autonomous vehicles team.
What You'll Be Doing:
Taking algorithms from initial evaluation and experimentation all the way to shipping them as part of the NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK and related products.
Developing and optimizing software architecture for real-world performance while matching or exceeding customer requirements.

Collecting map data, working on storage systems, fusing and mining data, integrating into a cloud-based service.
Solidifying existing algorithms, and working with large amounts of real and synthetic data to continuously improve the algorithmic and computational performance.
Performing in-vehicle tests, capturing data and completing autonomous drive missions.
Developing unit tests, documentation for features, evaluating quality and proposing corrective actions.
Developing highly efficient product code in C++, making use of high algorithmic parallelism offered by GPGPU programming (CUDA). Code written must comply to strict quality and safety standards such as defined by MISRA.
What We Need To See:
MS degree and 8+ years of industry experience
To be successful you should have experience in one or more of the following areas: Computer vision, visual geometry, LIDAR perception, SLAM and/or deep learning.
Experience building robust software.
Have strong programming and debugging skills in C++ and real-time multi-threaded software development.
Good communications and analytical skills. Ability to work with multiple cross-functional teams across multiple time zones.
Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd:
Experience developing real-time LIDAR Perception and/or Computer Vision systems and / or scalable cloud based mapping solutions.
Experience fusing data from different sensor modalities (e.g. Images and LIDAR data) to enable information conflation, label propagation, cross training for deep learning.
Experience with visual geometry and deep learning in a shipping product context.
Software development on embedded platforms or large scale cloud services.

And you'll check in regularly with employees about their career goals to make sure they continue to learn and grow. In addition, you will hire additional top talent and manage performance for each member in your team

Project Management: You will be a driver of change and will own projects that your team is delivering. The Machine Learning Infrastructure team's initiatives will only reach fruition with the help of the software teams across the company. You will skillfully delegate, get commitments, create schedules, hold teams accountable and escalate as needed to deliver cross team initiatives.

Founded by the pioneers of real-time bidding (RTB), The Trade Desk has become the fastest growing demand-side platform (DSP) in the industry by offering agencies and their advertisers a best-in-classtechnology platform that focuses on delivering meaningful and relevant engagement with consumers.

With integrations into every major advertising exchange, we handle well over 2 trillion requests every month and growing that's more page views and queries than Facebook, Google Search, and Google's entire network of websites combined all serviced in single-digit-ms response times. Are you interested in working with big data? Do you want to push the edges of scale and responsiveness? It doesn't get much bigger or faster than this!

We are looking for full-stack SOA engineers with grit. Every day we're solving problems that have either never been solved before, or have never been solved at this scale. We run our team very fast and very lean, which means every engineer has a high degree of ownership and potential impact and we are looking for candidates with the chops to handle it.

Recently named one of the top 10 most promising companies in America by Forbes Magazine and one of the ""Best Places To Work"" in the nation by Outdoor Magazine, The Trade Desk offers a culture of ""relaxed intensity"" one that comes from working alongside one of the most talented teams in our industry, and leading in a race that is ours to lose.

You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk development team if:
You are a full-stack SOA engineer / generalist. Experience and (just as important) interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes (walking down the stack): AngularJS SPA development, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, big data processing (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.), and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all (because they often will).
You have a track record of significant, specific, and self-directed contributions to large and challenging projects. What we're getting at here is ""grit"" or ""street cred"" some proof that this isn't your first rodeo, and you have learned some lessons the hard way.
You lead with humility and confidence. Our engineers have the opportunity (and are expected) to exercise a high degree of leadership and expertise in their daily work, having strongly held and defensible ideas, and advocating for what they believe is right. But they also need to be eager to hear differing opinions, adept at identifying and evaluating trade offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to help out their follow teammates.
You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do a lot of development in C#/.NET, but specific experience here is not required.
We also hope you'll take some time to learn more about The Trade Desk and what it's like to work here. Here are a few links to help get you started:

241|Software Engineer, Networking|"Lyft's Infrastructure engineers are responsible for building the systems and tools that make our teams productive and the technology stack that powers the applications our customers use every day. This position is a role on Lyft's networking team. You will have the opportunity to work on our back-end routing and discovery systems, create services that make up the control plane of Lyft's network, design and build the frontend for an increasingly large service footprint, and build tools that provide performance monitoring and observability to the rest of the engineering team.

As an engineer in the Infrastructure organization, there's no limit to the impact you can have on the business. All of our engineering teams are responsible for deploying and supporting their own services, and because of this they look to us for advice, guidance, and stability. We anticipate Lyft's driver, passenger, and engineering growth, and we build systems to support it. We invest heavily in infrastructure because we know that engineers are happiest when they're shipping code and passengers happiest when their rides arrive on time.

We believe in picking the right tools for the job, whether that means open source solutions, third party libraries or vendors, or building something in house. We aren't dogmatic about technologies and we adapt our systems based on the needs of the organization and product.

To give you an idea of what the team is doing day to day, the following is a list of our recent projects.
Envoy and the OSS ecosystem supporting it. This is the group that developed and is running one of the most cutting edge service mesh infrastructures in the industry at scale (envoyproxy.io). While Envoy has taken on a life of its own, there are a lot of related components in the ecosystem that we're still developing.
Ratelimit: Using our service-to-service mesh, Envoy, Lyft's systems need to be self-protecting. We've built systems to track connection attempts, rate-limit runaway clients and circuit-break exponential behaviours. Next steps for these systems are to make them learning and self-configuring so service developers can get guidance and automation about their ratelimits and circuit breaking config.
Service Discovery: We've built a back-end for tracking a dynamically scaling fleet of microservices. Using our service-mesh, we monitor service-to-service health to balance load and ensure only updated services get API calls. In the near future, we're going to centralize health-checking and incorporate Kubernetes service discovery and routing.
Cloud Interconnect: Empowering Lyft's use of multiple clouds means a rock-solid interconnect solution. We're creating the automation to manage and scale private connectivity between regions and clouds. There aren't a lot of companies with our scale and need for reliability doing this - that means we get to design new solutions and write the software for them.
Responsibilities:

The following lists some responsibilities our team members have. Members of the team have differing strengths and weaknesses and therefore work on different things. Think about whether these interest you.
Creating the abstraction layer that enforces best practices for Lyft's use of the network.
Developing automation to scale Lyft's network presence with demand.
Championing best practices for building scalable and reliable services and APIs.
Creating systems that automate fleet-wide network configuration and routing.
Conducting root cause analysis on production issues with other engineers.
Responding to production incidents and determining how we can prevent them in the future.
Contributing your ideas on how we can continuously improve our systems and processes.
Experience & Skills:

These are some things we are looking for in our next team member. Note that you do not need to have all these skills to apply. Not all of our team members have all of these qualities and our team works on a lot of different projects. These are just an accumulation of skills that would help with this job. We encourage you to apply if you have even one bullet point.

Passionate about software quality, repeatability, testability and maintainability, you are known to your co-workers as the go-to person for answers to questions that begin with the phrase “what’s the best way to…” – even though your answers tend to start with “help me understand what you’re trying to accomplish by…”.

You understand the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in production, and your designs and implementations reflect that understanding.

When you’re wrong, you’re happy to learn something. You build software quickly, but properly (so that you don’t have to go back to it later). You know what “unit tests” are and don’t implement software without them. Shipping on time with high quality makes your heart feel warm.

AFT builds and operates software, hardware, and the processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers that move billions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when promised. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.

Our inventory management system is the authoritative source of information for billions of inventory units that Amazon holds in its Fulfillment Centers (FC), worldwide. As new inventory arrives at the FC, the system will route products to optimal locations within the FC based on space availability, customer demand and buying patterns. The system tracks the state of all items and their location, and will share the availability to upstream systems, to make the items sellable on the Amazon website. Based on a customer order, the system will reserve specific items and track them through various stages of order fulfillment, until the customer shipment departs the FC. This system monitors for discrepancies between virtual and physical states to measure the quality of our data and decisions. Finally, the inventory management system is responsible for tracking the costs associated with inventory transactions, so that Amazon can account for owned assets on behalf of retail owners and third party sellers, in real time.

As an engineer in Inventory Control, you will be challenged with building and driving innovative and scalable systems that manage Amazon inventory globally.

Your code will understand customer product related questions, source answers from unstructured and semi-structured data, index them, and reply in real time. Your platform will improve the experience for millions of customers by learning from new data, user behaviour, and better models.

What is the softest pillow? Amazon’s product reviews answer this question. You need to help us get at that data and surface it for our customers.

When customers ask if a product is “green,” are they referring to the color of the product, or its environmental qualities? Your code will make this decision.

When should I change my water filter? You will need to cross reference purchase history and product accessory info to help Alexa get this one right.

Our vision is that Alexa will be the world's most knowledgeable product expert who knows you personally, in a store that sells everything. For all those moments when you need or want to know more about the products you use every day, just ask Alexa.

585|Full- Stack Software Development Engineer|"Job Description
We are looking for innovative engineers to form the core of a new applications development team. This is truly a ground floor opportunity and you will have the opportunity to help shape the team’s technology and culture from inception.
This organization has the charter to build software that will revolutionize the support business by empowering the engineers and representatives who assist AWS' customers at all levels to provide unparalleled service. This team will own the relationship with the business unit and work directly with the support engineers and leadership to define a plan for delving the software their business critically needs. You will own the execution of that plan, delivering applications incrementally for your customers by obsessing over their needs so that they can focus on their obsession for AWS' customers.

Historically these business units have crowd sourced the tools they need; this team will use that as a starting point to pick what works and reimagine was doesn’t. You will have the ability to build with all of the combined power of both AWS and the Amazon retail development tooling at your disposal. By joining at the very beginning you will get to influence the design choices. Do you like scala over Java or prefer node.js to ruby? This is your chance to make the business value case for the best technology to build with before it becomes entrenched in “what we use” or “how we do things.”

Who We Are
Amazon.com has been rated one of the most admired company in the US, #1 in Innovation and # 1 in Customer Service. Additionally, Amazon’s technology business has a history and growing tradition of leading the world in Web-related technologies and services. Now, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), you have the opportunity to help individuals and businesses take their computing infrastructure and applications into the Cloud. AWS has gained a reputation for innovation with a fast pace release cycle delivering hundreds of features a year, and AWS Support is one of the largest and fastest growing AWS business units.

Don’t be confused by the name. We are a highly technical, innovative organization revolutionizing the way customers engage and seek help from AWS. Our customers include very large Enterprises (e.g. NASDAQ, Adobe, Kellogg's, Unilever); Public Sector (e.g. NASA JPL, Stanford) as well as fast growing businesses and internet companies (e.g. Netflix, Airbnb). We will redefine the word “support” and lead the industry with best in class technology. The AWS Support organization is global with team members in 20 locations around the world. The organization is a self-standing business with revenue and P&L responsibility.

If you share a passion for having a close relationship to your customers, they are all within easy reach; or for leading the design decisions that make them successful, your solutions will enable the support experienced by 1000’s of AWS customers across the globe. This is the job for you!

About the team
The Amazon Family and Baby Registry teams have long worked closely together to reach expecting parents and parents of young children. In 2018, we combined these two teams into one Parent Experience (PX) organization to better position our program for growth and agility.
The PX team’s vision is to reach “every parent, every day” globally by positioning Amazon as a preferred retailer for expecting (especially first-time) parents through parents of children age 5 or under, unlocking the full potential of parent customers for all of Amazon. There is significant competition to reach this customer segment because when customers become pregnant and subsequently have a child, their overall purchases increase, their choice of retailers are consolidated, and they have a higher likelihood to shop online due to a greater need for convenience. Our objective is to identify, engage, and delight this highly attractive customer segment. Our mission to achieve our vision globally is to make parents’ lives easier, helping them to navigate what can often be an overwhelming process of researching how to prepare for their child’s developmental milestones. We will do this by building scalable, self-service, and learning solutions that surface to parents what they need, when they need it and by creating personalized, parent-centric shopping experiences that are unique to the age & stage of their child(ren). Our three-pronged strategy to accomplish this is: 1) to build functionality to identify every parent on Amazon as early as possible, ideally prenatally; 2) to make parents’ lives easier by recognizing and predicting shopping intent to show them what they need, when they need it (including content, products, and high-value actions (HVAs)); and 3) to accelerate the Amazon flywheel by using data to help our stakeholders reach parent customers more effectively.
The Challenges We Will Tackle
Our focus is building capabilities, learning model, and scalable systems/tools to identify and engage parents. Through these capabilities and systems, we will unlock unprecedented ability to reach these parents wherever they are, increasing the value that we bring to them, by surfacing new brands, products, and highly relevant offers and content with representation across all Amazon’s offerings and geographies.
Parent Experience will tackle some of the toughest problems, which stretches over both retail and digital world.
· Streamline the purchase experience across all Family associated product lines.
· Inspire our customers with comfortable and easy shopping experiences and relevant products.
· Personalize customer experience for both parent customers and their household members without the need for account switching to help them find useful information and best-choice products that match preference and style of each family member.
· Provide expert advice and information that help guide our customers in their purchase decision making process.
· Allow customers to create profile for each household member and use that to influence the shopping experience on Amazon.
· Improve the customer’s search/browse experience on the website by providing intelligent filter using user profile and life events.
The Technology
In order to achieve our vision, we think big and tackle technology challenges. Where technology does not exist, we will build it. Where it exists we will need to tune/modify/improve it to make it well working at Amazon scale and fitting Parent Experience ecosystem. As the problem is so wide and the team new, we need members who are passionate and willing to learn and do innovation.
We have designed our technical architecture with the objective of increasing feature velocity, scalability and improving CX consistency, which enabling customization where needed. This architecture supports rapid experimentation, global simultaneous deployments, and self-service capabilities that allow our program team to build experiences without dev team involvement.
· Amazon scale systems. All our technology needs to work at Amazon scale, serving hundreds of millions of customers with millisecond level latencies.
· Big data & analytics. Amazon is data driven and a strong data backbone is necessary in our systems. We build up core AWS services such as EC2, S3, DynamoDB, etc.
· Personalization and machine learning. All technologies will be used in experiences adapted to what customer need, want or prefer. We will be working with advanced machine learning technologies to tackle these problems.
· User interface & web development. We will create beautiful and dynamic frontend experiences that requires deep knowledge of relevant technologies such as JQuery, Horizonte, AUI, etc.
· Besides traditional surfaces as desktop/mobile browser and mobile applications, we will build new customer interaction channel through smart-home devices.
Our Culture and You
We love challenging problems and like to move fast in a growing and changing environment. We use data to guide our decisions and we always push the technology and process boundaries of what is feasible on behalf of our customers. The most successful members of our team are obsessed with helping our customers in creative ways, bring clarity to ambiguity through data driven experimentation, and think big to build solution extensible enough to handle existing and upcoming use cases.
This team is a great fit for you if
· You like to work on projects that have a direct impact to millions of customers across the globe.
· You truly care about the business results of what you build, not just the elegance of the technology you build.
· You like work on the end to end stack (Platforms, UI, services, databases, distributed systems).
· You adapt to change well.
If that sounds like an environment you like, join us.

647|Sr. Business Intelligence Engineer: Internationalization Metrics Platform|"Job Description
Amazon.com's long-term vision is to enable a seamless experience for all Amazon customers worldwide on any Amazon website and device, in any language and for any culture. This extends the personalization of the shopping experience by allowing our customers to define their preferred language and currency and ensure that we provide an equivalent experience for our customers in their language of preference as we do customers in the default marketplace language. Our organization’s goal is to provide a framework allowing us to define and measure the quality of these experiences and accelerate language adoption across marketplaces. We believe that, by establishing a platform team and providing tools and mechanisms, we can broadly influence change across Amazon while auditing the quality of our customer experiences.

We are looking for a Business Intelligence Engineer (BIE) with strong analytical, communication and project management skills to join our team. Working closely with business stakeholders and senior leadership, you will help identify and solve complex language and currency problems, and develop metrics and reports to measure our impact on Amazon’s business. In a typical day, you will work closely with the product management team, retail teams, machine-learning scientists, statisticians, software engineers, and various business groups.

About you:
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.

You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Amazon Retail as a whole -- from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

About us together:
We're going to change the way that Amazon thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal candidate for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment, strong data mining and modeling skills and is comfortable facilitating ideation and working from concept through to execution. You will have demonstrated an ability to manage and develop medium to large-scale data tables, identify requirements and build financial reporting and planning models and tools that are statistically grounded but also explainable operationally, apply technical skills allowing the models to adapt to changing attributes, optimize forecast accuracy and to better understand and mitigate model variance drivers. In addition to building data tables, modeling and technical skills, you will possess strong written and verbal communication skills, strong focus on internal customers and professional demeanor and high intellectual curiosity with ability to learn new concepts and frameworks, algorithms and technology rapidly as changes arise.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of Amazon's global retail business) and employ BigData techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within the Amazon marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest BigData streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

765|Software Development Engineer - Machine Learning|"Job Description
Fashion. Style. Elegance. These are words that are easy to appreciate and understand for a human, but hard for algorithms and computers. Recommending fashion – yes, that is the space that we work in. We blend a variety of disciplines (such as recommender systems, data mining, NLP, big data, semantic web, graph stores and cloud computing) to turn an intractable problem into a hard problem. For example: just because someone bought a purple dress does not mean that purple is the right color for them for all seasons; neither does it mean that you should recommend purple accessories. Just when someone buys a shirt, which tie in Amazon’s vast selection would it make most sense to pair with it? While there are other recommendation problems out there, none of them capture the scale of the problem (think size times color), the rapidly changing inventory (each season changes what’s cool) along with unique problems of fit, fabric and finish.
So how do we do it? We are a full stack team that own components all the way from dataset generation, high performance service oriented architecture to building great UIs that can surface recommendations in a pleasing and aesthetically appealing way. We work with a talented group of UX designers, data scientists, machine learning experts and UI developers. As for techniques, we experiment with collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and have recently started using deep learning. You don’t need to be fashionista or a shopaholic. But, if you know what peplum means and colorblocking is more than just the two words put together, you are already ahead of the curve (or perhaps you watch Project Runway…. which also works!). If you want to be on the cutting edge of personalization in ecommerce retail and reaching customers in a unique and valuable space, this is the team to be on! We have the mandate and ability to effect big changes, we just need the right person to begin.
As a Software Development Engineer, you will own and build infrastructure that accesses terabyte of data to produce and deliver datasets with low latency and high reliability. The goal is to assemble features and services quickly that can make a huge impact on the customer experience. What recommendations data could you use to make search more personalized? How can we use product similarity and sales data to augment and enrich our recommendations? Software Engineers at Amazon are more than just order takers; they see a problem and leverage innovative technology to address it. We're looking for people who innovate, love solving hard problems, and never take ""no"" for an answer. You will be able to build systems that will impact millions of customers and create multi-million dollar revenue opportunities, ship in just a couple of weeks and instantly measure the dollar value of what you have developed. And be able to go home and show your friends and family the impact of what you are doing!
Major Responsibilities:

Analyze and extract relevant information from large amounts of Amazon's historical business data to help automate and optimize key features and processes.

Work closely with stakeholders to optimize various business operations

Developing recommendation algorithms to power features on Amazon

Inferring customer intent to suggest relevant items, categories or brands to all customers

Finding powerful product relationships,

Reducing latency to make the shopping experience blazingly fast
Basic Qualifications
BS in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, related field, or equivalent experience.

4+ years of experience in software development and building large platform systems

A proven track record of hiring and developing careers of software engineers

You will be working in the designing, building and finally shipping these products together with partners, product management, other engineers and data scientists.

CUSTOMER FACING TOOLS - all our processes are driven through a toolset that we have built. You will establish the roadmap for our customer facing functionalities, ensure prioritization and ultimately build these features. Shipping a high quality toolset always requires being data driven and having strong engineering skills. You need to be obsessed with ensuring the best end to end experience for our customers.

JOB DESCRIPTION
Amazon's Advertising Platform is positioned to grow its share of the online advertising industry due to its unique combination of online retail behavior data, industry-leading cloud services, and a fast-moving startup culture. The targeting platform enables our ad systems to deliver the right ads to the right users. To accomplish this goal, we are applying the latest low latency, big data technologies and toolsets which allow us to understand our users interests and personalize their experiences.

About you:
You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack -- from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

TARGETING - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. This data can be used to help us decide what else they are likely to be interested in and to respond to. Accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. . You will be working with other driven engineers to deliver our features and solutions. This will require core engineering and programming skills, insight, technical capability, data driven decision making, creativity and an obsession to ship high quality solutions for our customers.

MACHINE LEARNING & ANALYTICS - there's an almost overwhelming amount of data available, and we need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict any measurable signal. You will be working in the designing, building and finally shipping these products together with partners, product management, other engineers and data scientists.

CUSTOMER FACING TOOLS - all our processes are driven through a toolset that we have built. You will establish the roadmap for our customer facing functionalities, ensure prioritization and ultimately build these features. Shipping a high quality toolset always requires being data driven and having strong engineering skills. You need to be obsessed with ensuring the best end to end experience for our customers.

895|Sr Network Development Engineer - Border Engineering - AWS|"Job Description
The AWS Networking organization is hiring, and we’re looking for talented Network Development Engineers (NDE) to join our team. Within Networking, we’re confronting and solving complex and high-stake challenges. Our teams support all aspects of connectivity to/from Amazon and the outside world, as well as the connectivity between Amazon’s data centers and services. As a member of one our network engineering teams, you will play a part in designing and architecting networks that simply cannot fail, must scale infinitely, and can never constrain growth or innovation.

This opportunity sits within our Internet Services organization where the team is responsible for designing the networks connecting Amazon directly to the outside world (including the Internet, peers, and external customers), evolving the global backbone that interconnects our Regions as well as partnering with our internal customers. Engineers in this organization define routing policy, design and implement Traffic Engineering solutions, as well as architect the hardware platforms and network design to support internal and external connectivity. We move terabits of traffic in and out of our networks each day and are responsible for the ingress and egress points of traffic entering and leaving Amazon as well as the entirety of all internal and customer traffic that rides our global backbone. Engineers on this team make day-to-day and strategic decisions that carry a huge amount of responsibility and impact.


Responsibilities
As a Network Development Engineer at Amazon, your core job responsibility is to design network topologies, architectures, and services that solve for many requirements. We listen to our customers (both internal and external), but we also listen to our teams. Our Engineers contribute materially to each team’s roadmap, and constantly help us to determine what’s most important. Together, you and your leadership team will decide on the projects that best support your team’s mission. You will have the resources and time necessary to understand, scope, and deliver these solutions. The primary area of responsibility you and your team will have is to design ahead of customer or technology needs, always predicting and solving for problems that have not yet occurred. This takes the form of creating and defending High Level Design (HLD) documents, working with vendors or internal stakeholders to influence technology roadmaps, constructing and testing your solutions, and providing support to the teams that will deploy and operate these designs. Our teams also serve as technical escalation points in support of our very talented operations teams.

Basic Qualifications
Bachelor’s Degree in a technology related field or equivalent experience to a Bachelor's degree based on 3 years professional experience for every 1 year of education
3+ years professional experience working in large scale networking environments.
Knowledge and experience with internet routing protocols and concepts: TCP/IP, BGP, MPLS, ISIS and/or OSPF
Knowledge and experience with network operating systems such as Cisco IOS and Junos.
Experience working in a Linux/Unix environment
Experience in automation via Bash/shell scripting and Perl/Python programming.
Preferred Qualifications
Knowledge of network analysis fundamentals and robust troubleshooting skills; specifically, network performance analysis
Experience working with customers to diagnose a problem, and work toward resolution
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
