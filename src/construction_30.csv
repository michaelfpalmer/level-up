Position Title: Graduate Research Student Assistant

Start Date: 7/23/2018

End Date: 9/25/2018

This position is 40 hours per week.

Position Description

IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Graduate Research Assistant to join the Cost Effectiveness team. The Graduate Research Assistant will have the opportunity to learn about data analysis and cost effectiveness in the context of global disease burden, risks, causes, and interventions. IHME’s Cost Effectiveness team is currently developing a machine-learning approach to analyze all available data on cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) using the Tufts Medical Center CEA registries. The registries serve as a repository of cost effectiveness data from the literature that uses two metrics to assess the impact of a specific health intervention in a country or region: cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Our goal is to meta-regress all of the available cost per QALY and cost per DALY data to predict a full range of cost effectiveness ratios for each country and health intervention. For additional information in the registries, see Neumann et al. Comparing the cost-per-QALYs gained and cost-per-DALYs averted literatures. Gates Open Research. 2018.

For this project, the Graduate Research Assistant will assist in the preparation of data for statistical modeling. Specific duties will involve researching existing health intervention taxonomies, evaluating them against the project’s needs, and coding registry entries using the selected taxonomy. If existing taxonomies show little promise for the registry data, the Graduate Research Assistant will have the opportunity to develop a custom system for classifying and structuring the data, as well as to test and document the taxonomy and present findings to all project collaborators. The Graduate Research Assistant’s contribution will impact future global health research on cost effectiveness, by illuminating which health interventions should be of highest priority in addressing global disease burden moving forward.

Duties include:
Research existing health intervention taxonomies and apply results to the standardization and classification of Tufts Medical Center registry data
Code registry entries using the selected taxonomy
Extract additional information from articles in registry to code entries consistently and accurately
Perform quality assurance on coding and data
Develop documentation to share methods and results with collaborators at IHME
Present project findings to IHME Cost Effectiveness team
Participate in other research activities as needed by the project
Minimum Requirements

167|Senior Program Officer, Sanitation Industry & Technology Transition Liaison|"The Global Growth & Opportunity (GGO) division works to catalyze sustainable transformative change in the face of inequities and market failures, to realize the potential of untapped markets, and to see the economic and social benefits of including everyone. We focus on the areas of Agricultural Development; Financial Services for the Poor; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene; and Gender Equality. We seek solutions that are sustainable, transformative, and inclusive with an eye toward applying technology innovations as well as data evidence to drive change in the world’s developing countries.

4.5 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed sanitation, and millions of these people live in dwellings whose sanitary facilities, if any, are connected to poorly managed septic tanks, cesspools or latrines. Health impacts of poorly managed sanitation are severe, including hundreds of millions of cases of serious oral-fecal illnesses each year, resulting in the preventable deaths of approximately 1.7 million young children, and lifelong stunting and cognitive impairment of tens of millions more children

Traditional sewer networks have historically been the preferred sanitation solution among urban planners and governments. However, this large and centralized infrastructure is often not the most sustainable, nor financially or technically feasible solution in developing countries, and often does not reach informal settlement populations and other vulnerable groups for a range of reasons including sewers not extending beyond central business districts, challenging topography, lack of legal recognition by government, or project cost estimates that don’t include the costs to connect poor households to sewers.

These factors make non-sewered sanitation solutions (NSS), also known as onsite sanitation systems, more context-appropriate and adaptable in many urban contexts. The Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WSH) team focuses their efforts and resources towards advocating and developing an end-to-end ecosystem promoting NSS. This is achieved through:
Policy, Advocacy, and Communication (PAC) targets our focus regions to promote national policies and increase government accountability for responsible fecal sludge management (FSM). In addition, focus is also placed on advocating for funding innovative non-sewered sanitation interventions globally.
Transformative Technology Commercialization (TTC)supports upstream development of innovative technologies that practically address the sanitation challenge and respects the realities of developing world needs. Current focus has shifted towards bringing these technologies to market through diverse and locally relevant commercialization strategies.
Urban Sanitation Markets (USM) places emphasis on developing the market and ecosystem for city wide inclusive sanitation services, regulation, and transformative technologies. This includes building the capacity of those responsible for sanitation services to develop appropriate business models and build effective NSS systems and infrastructure. This is achieved through collaboration with national governments, development banks, private sectors, universities, and other supportive organizations.
Measurement, Evidence, and Dissemination for Scale (MEDS)is tasked with strengthening the evidence base for successful and innovative sanitation programs, supporting smart measurement and indicators within our grant making, and helping the NSS sector more broadly implement evidenced based programming through dissemination of findings.
As mentioned above, the Transformative Technology Commercialization (TTC) strategy leads the upstream development of innovative technologies and the WSH team has partnered with many universities and industries to develop these technologies as core processing systems or key components for the next generation of safe and sustainable sanitation solutions. These technologies will enable the development, manufacturing and deployment of Reinvented Toilets (as defined by ISO30500), Omni-Ingestors (inline pit emptying and waste treatment solutions) and Omni-Processors (energy independent fecal sludge processing technologies, as defined by ISO/IWA28); which aim to kill pathogens from human waste and waste streams and turn human waste into marketable products that support an entrepreneur’s business profitability. In addition to the upstream work, the WSH team is also partnering with leading industry and commercial entities around the world to successfully deploy these technologies in communities in developing and developed countries where they will have the most health and economic benefits.

Position Summary & Responsibilities

The Senior Program Officer (SPO), Sanitation Industry and Technology Transition Liaison will be responsible for advancing the transition of core technologies within the WSH portfolio to industry and commercial partners. In collaboration with other colleagues, you will recruit and onboard new industry players, facilitate licensing of intellectual property (where relevant) and the development of Global Access[1] strategies while providing strategic support through the product development life cycle to successful commercial launch. This strategic guidance to industry is aimed at helping commercial partners meet the foundation’s charitable goals for accelerating access to sustainable sanitation services for poor urban communities in developing countries.

The charitable goals of our program depend on the development of a new industry and on these new markets being sustainably profitable for our commercial partners. The imperative for growing this industry comes from the urgency to reduce the rates of death and disease, in these regions, due to poor sanitation and hygiene.

As a strong industry interface, you will lead the WSH team’s efforts to identify the best matches from industry for the leading technologies in the WSH portfolio. You will be expected to:
Develop and maintain a database for technologies and intellectual properties of interest to the foundation and commercial partners that may have potential application in the sanitation industry.
Maintain and nurture this set of partners while working both internally and externally to facilitate a wide range of business support, market research and analytical projects to encourage private sector technology uptake, transfer and commercialization.
In addition to the above, the SPO will have responsibility to:
Develop strategies and lead foundation efforts to identify and successfully engage industry and commercial partners for the commercialization of innovative sanitation technologies. Make appropriate investments to accelerate technology transfer and commitment for commercial product launch.
In collaboration with business partners and the foundation legal team, drive industry engagement to successfully develop business plans and go-to-market strategies that satisfy the foundation’s Global Access requirements.
Support commercial partners in framing business opportunities for their senior executives.
Where relevant, coordinate with university technology transfer offices on negotiations of test licenses and/or commercial licenses to ensure smooth and fast transactions that meet the foundation’s Global Access requirements.
Monitor and evaluate commercial partners progress against Global Access requirements to advise on strategy adjustments and commercialization goals.
Following closure of technology transfer and licensing agreements, coordinate the transition of key relationships to appropriate colleagues for further product launch and commercialization.
Coordinate with team members working on market development to ensure commercial partners have access to relevant market and partnership opportunities.
Hire and manage a team of consultants, as appropriate, to lead market studies, industry or technology

landscape to inform strategy execution.

----------------------------------------------------

What is Time and Attendance all about?

We’ve all heard about 24/7/365. That’s 8760 hours in a year. Now multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of hourly workers at Amazon … those who work in our fulfillment, customer service and data centers; employees in our growing number of Amazon Books bookstores and more. On every continent (well, ok, not Antarctica… at least, not yet). Factor in the crazy number of different variations of a “work week,” work day, overtime, and an equally daunting amount of reporting requirements.

Can you keep track of which of those were work hours and which are not? Difficult… yes? Excited yet?

Are you up for the challenge? Think big and join the team that will track billions of hours a year to ensure our employees are paid accurately.

Who are we looking for to join our team?

PeopleTech is looking for a smart, inventive Product Manager who is passionate about building and launching highly functional Time and Attendance systems all over the world. The best candidates will rely on data, insights and customer input to construct the product vision, and will bring experience managing complex projects, launching and implementing large-scale systems, and cultivating deep trust with key stakeholders. Responsibilities include owning a portfolio of global project implementations and launches, sifting through competing priorities and complex requirements to clarify and solidify the roadmap, driving change management strategy and execution, and establishing and measuring key performance metrics to assess implementation success. Above all, success is predicated on meticulous organizational skills, high attention to detail, spot-on judgement, and ultimately an unbending predisposition that vigorously advocates for the customer.

If your immediate reaction is a Bill Murray-esque “me, me, me also;” or even “I am really close on this one…” then we want to hear from you!

Basic Qualifications
· 5+ years of Product or Program Management experience in a complex environment
· Demonstrated skills in developing product roadmaps & functional specifications, launching new products, conducting customer research, and facilitating user testing.

The Team:
The Amazon Point-of-Sale (POS) team is responsible for building POS systems for all Amazon physical retail stores. We started off with Amazon Books, a brick-and-mortar store that offers a curated selection of books, and merchandise such as Amazon devices. These stores provide a magical experience that combines the best parts of a neighborhood bookstore with Amazon.com’s low prices and the expertise of passionate, knowledgeable staff who tailor their approach to the unique needs of each customer and use our systems to do so. We are getting ready to launch new products that will amaze and define how customers interact with us in a brick and mortar setting.

The Role: Everyone on the team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and cooperate in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than a big company. As a Software Development Engineer in the POS team, you will collaborate with a team of talented engineers to build great native software on beautiful hardware that store associates and customers use to navigate the checkout experience. In addition, you should be able to develop highly-scaled, low latency solutions for front-end (JavaScript, CSS), middle tier (Java, Spring) and backend NoSQL databases. You will ensure that the best engineering practices are followed and that our software is designed to be responsive, reliable and maintainable.

In this role:
You will encounter challenging, novel situations every day and work on them in touch with multiple technical teams across Amazon in different locations.
You'll need to be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems that, frankly, haven’t been taken on at scale before. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on millions of people.
You will spend most of your time using higher level language constructs because that is usually the fastest way to get things done, but you will get your hands dirty with OS API calls when you need to.

Basic Qualifications
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related technical discipline
6+ years professional experience in software development
Fluency in Java, C# or other object-oriented languages.
Passion and established experience in full stack software development

Highly analytical and data-driven: You solve problems in ways that are backed up with data. You focus on driving processes, tools, and statistical methods which support rational decision-making.

Humbitious: You are ambitious, yet humble. You recognize that there is always opportunity for improvement and use introspection and feedback from teammates and peers to raise the bar for your team.
Ambigu-capable: You are able to explore new problem spaces with unique constraints and thus non-obvious solutions; you are quick to identify any gaps in the team and the right person to fill them to best deliver value to customers
You will:
Own technical vision and direction: You identify and mitigate risks, construct project schedules, and prepare status reports; you embrace performance metrics and measurement techniques because they help you assess how well system-related services are running.
Build and grow your team: You will be accountable for building an engineering team that delivers results. This means you will wear a lot of hats -- from coaching individuals, to leading technical discussions, recruiting, establishing processes, and so on. You will be an example of Amazon's leadership principles and work to grow more leaders within your group.
Collaborate on product direction: You will build and maintain strong relationships between engineering and partner disciplines (Applied Science, Product, User Experience, QA) to ensure that we are focused on delivering the right product for customers.
Lead beyond your team: You will be a key part of a small but growing community of engineering leaders who support their teams and contribute to the overall growth of our product development organization. You will share your best practices and technical acumen in order to drive technology decisions across our organization.
Own your own shop: Our products reach hundreds of millions of customers around the world. We run operations 24x7x365 and the services your team delivers must meet high standards for operational excellence. Our teams own and operate the systems we build.

Program Manager, Time and Attendance – PeopleTech

PeopleTech is looking for a Program Manager to shape the future to lead complex projects and implement best-in-class Time and Attendance solutions.

----------------------------------------------------

What is Time and Attendance all about?

We’ve all heard about 24/7/365. That’s 8760 hours in a year. Now multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of hourly workers at Amazon … those who work in our fulfillment, customer service and data centers; employees in our growing number of Amazon Books bookstores and more. On every continent (well, ok, not Antarctica… at least, not yet). Factor in the crazy number of different variations of a “work week,” work day, overtime, and an equally daunting amount of reporting requirements.

Can you keep track of which of those were work hours and which are not? Difficult… yes? Excited yet?

Are you up for the challenge? Think big and join the team that will track billions of hours a year to ensure our employees are paid accurately.

Who are we looking for to join our team?

PeopleTech is looking for a smart, inventive Program Manager who is passionate about building and launching highly functional Time and Attendance systems all over the world. The best candidates will rely on data, insights and customer input to construct the product vision, and will bring experience managing complex projects, launching and implementing large-scale systems, and cultivating deep trust with key stakeholders. Responsibilities include owning a portfolio of global project implementations and launches, sifting through competing priorities and complex requirements to clarify and solidify the roadmap, driving change management strategy and execution, and establishing and measuring key performance metrics to assess implementation success. Above all, success is predicated on meticulous organizational skills, high attention to detail, spot-on judgement, and ultimately an unbending predisposition that vigorously advocates for the customer.

If your immediate reaction is a Bill Murray-esque “me, me, me also;” or even “I am really close on this one…” then we want to hear from you!

419|Software Engineer, Connected Games|"In the last several years powerful and flexible game platforms have changed the nature of game development. There are teams all over the world telling their stories and building their games who couldn't have done so a decade ago. Successful and established companies are allowing small, talented teams to tackle new and unproven ideas, confident that they can turn concept into reality without risking the team's future. It's an amazing time of imagination, experimentation, and empowerment...unless the experience you're trying to build is connected in any way.

Communication edge cases, hosting complexity, deployment headaches, security you didn't know you needed until it was too late, unpredictable hosting costs, forum posts complaining about downtime before you knew anything about it, overloaded servers one day, too many servers the next, the list goes on and on. Great experiences failing for one avoidable reason or another.

We're building a team in Bellevue to change that pattern, and the entire lifecycle of connected experiences. Conception, evaluation, prototype, development, testing, shipping, maintaining, expanding, and sunset. We're developing patterns, development tools, runtime features, services, deployment, monitoring, and hosting solutions. The good news is these are almost entirely solved problems. Every successful connected product has had to solve them. The hard part is how to make these accepted solutions available to people who've never had to use a service, and ensure the choices they're making are the right ones by default. It's an enormous job, which is why we need you.

What You'll Be Doing:
Design and build service infrastructure and tools for an incredibly diverse set of developers
Contribute to a platform which is expected to have staggering concurrence numbers
What You'll Need:
7+ years hands-on software engineering, preferably full stack
2+ years of technical ownership and leadership
A passion for enabling the success of others
Experience working with connected products, preferably working on multiple parts of those products
A desire to own the entire lifetime of solutions, from planning through support
Comfortable working in languages and platforms you may have never used before
The ability to dig past easy solutions and solve the issues at the core of difficult problems
Great communication and teamwork skills across a broad range of disciplines
Bonus Points
Extensively supported, extended, or built a service platform or connected client
Game development experience or a strong understanding of the issues encountered by developers
Authentication, security, identity, and insight into the complications that arise from tackling those issues
A passion for privacy and security
